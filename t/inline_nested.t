#plan is a follows:
#
#  A test that sets signal handlers in nested blocks, and tests that
#  at each level of nesting, the signal handler at the next level up
#  is still valid (for the same signal).  The idea is that the scope of
#  the block prevents the next level up signal handle from being overwritten.

    NOTE: arm systems seem to have a defective implementation of perl POSIX
    signal handling.  This test will segfault on these platforms, if
    the block nesting is greater than 2... and I suspect if the block
    nesting itself is corrupting the call stack somehow.  This testing
    will be skipped on arm* platforms.

    All that said, this was an intentially a very twisted test.  It seems
    unlikely that one would really want to do what this tests for.  It is
    reasonable to nest signal handlers in nexted call stacks however:
    See recursive_nested.t, which does run on arm platforms.

    This test can be executed manually from the command line on arm platforms
    as follows:

       INLINE=1 perl -Ilib t/safe.t

    Lincoln\n\n" ;

      plan skip_all => "This test appears to corrupt perl's call stack on arm platforms" ;
   }
   plan tests => $tests;

   my $ctx0 = set_sig_handler( SIGALRM ,sub { print "in sighandler: level 0\n" ; $levels[0] = 1; } );

   eval {
      my $ctx1 = set_sig_handler( 'ALRM' ,'sighandler' ); 
      #print Dumper( $ctx1 );
      if ( 1 ) {

            my $ctx2 = set_sig_handler( SIGALRM ,sub { print "in sighandler: level 2\n"; $levels[2] = 3; } );
            eval {
               my $ctx3 = set_sig_handler( 'ALRM' ,sub {  print "in sighandler: level 3\n"; $levels[3] = 4; } );
               kill ALRM => $$;
